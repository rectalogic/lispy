# Lispy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rectalogic/lispy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rectalogic/lispy)

Scheme based Python extension language, derived from Peter Norvigs [lispy](https://norvig.com/lispy2.html).
Ported to Python 3 and refactored into a class to contain all interpreter state.
Also added the ability to expose a restricted subset of python methods and properties into scheme.
